# How-to-add-repository
Create a New Repository on GitHub:

Create a GitHub Account:

If you don't have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one. Go to GitHub and sign up.

Install Git:

Make sure you have Git installed on your local machine. You can download it from git-scm.com.

Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine:

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Use the following command, replacing <repository-url> with the URL of your GitHub repository:
git clone <repository-url>

Create a "Hello World" Program:

Create a new file, for example, hello_world.py in the cloned directory, and add the following Python code:
print("Hello, World!")

Commit Your Changes:
In the terminal, navigate to your repository's directory and use the following commands:

git add .
git commit -m "Add Hello World program"

Push to GitHub:
Push your changes to GitHub using the following command:

git push origin master

Now, if you visit your GitHub repository on the web, you should see the hello_world.py file with the "Hello, World!" program.
